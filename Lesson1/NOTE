Node works with asynchronous architecture - meaning it is using a non blocking architecture.
Node application are asynchronous by default.

Globally scoped objects in node are objects that are globally scoped. Meaning you can access them from anywhere.

For us to avoid the issues of conflicting code we should always modularise our code. The variables and files that we define 
in that module are scoped to that module alone. 

Every file in node is a module.
